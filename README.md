# NLP-amazon-foods
In this notebook I will work on a NLP model capable of predicting the food's scored based on the text review that an user has written for this food.

In order to reach this purpose, I have chosen the Amazon food dataset.

The "score" collumn is the number of rating assigned by an user for the food. The "text" collumn is the review.
